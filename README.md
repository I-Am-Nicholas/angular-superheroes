## Overview

- This is a tutorial. I have followed it thus far to build my understanding of Angular, and to lock-in the basics of my app.

- Having to follow the instructions step-by-step meant that I wasn't able to use TDD to this point, as the tutorial did not include testing.

- Now that I have completed the tutorial and the main structure of the app is laid out, I will start from scratch, doubling down on what I've learnt so far while learning and using TDD.
