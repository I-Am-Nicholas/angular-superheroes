## Overview

- This is a tutorial. I have followed it to build my understanding of Angular, and to lock-in the basics of my app.

- Having to follow the instructions step-by-step meant that I wasn't able to use TDD, as the tutorial did not include testing. Now that I have completed the tutorial I will start my app from scratch while learning TDD with Angular.
